          <p>I have obtained several data analysis and machine learning certificates from Coursera courses offered by Google, DeepLearning.AI, Stanford University, and Imperial College London. During my participation in the capstone project, I contributed to the development of a computer vision machine learning model aimed at detecting pets using captured images. Additionally, I collaborated with the project team to design a user interface (UI) for an Android mobile application. Furthermore, I was selected as one of the machine learning cohorts for the TensorFlow certification program.</p>
